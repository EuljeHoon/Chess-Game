## Overview

This is a complete chess game implementation written in Java. It includes all standard chess rules, including piece movement validation, pawn promotion, and game over detection. The game is played in the console using a coordinate-based system.

What makes this project unique is its **modular architecture**‚Äîeach piece type has its own class, and game logic is cleanly separated from the user interface. It also supports **FEN (Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation)** for initializing or saving board states.

## Tech Stack

### Core
- **Java** ‚Äî Object-oriented programming language
- **Java Collections** ‚Äî Used for managing board and pieces

### Game Engine
- **Custom Piece Classes** ‚Äî Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King
- **Board Management** ‚Äî 2D array-based board structure
- **Movement Validation** ‚Äî Rule-checking for legal moves

### User Interface
- **Console Input/Output** ‚Äî Scanner-based move input, terminal rendering

### Data Management
- **FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)** ‚Äî Load standard/custom board states
- **File I/O (planned)** ‚Äî Potential for saving/loading games

## üîß Modules and Functions

### Game Logic

**File:** `Game.java`  
- `main(String[] args)` ‚Äì Starts the game loop  
- Manages turn-based logic (White and Black)  
- Handles input and validates move formats  
- Detects game over (king capture)

---

### Piece Movement

**File:** `Piece.java` + individual subclasses  
- Abstract base class:  
  - `isMoveLegal(Board, endRow, endCol)` ‚Äì Delegates validation to subclasses  
  - `setPosition(row, col)` ‚Äì Updates piece position  
  - `promote()` ‚Äì Handles pawn promotion  
  - `getCharacter()` ‚Äì Returns Unicode symbol

- **Piece Subclasses:**
  - `Pawn` ‚Äî Move forward, diagonal capture, double first step, promotion
  - `Rook` ‚Äî Vertical/horizontal with path validation
  - `Knight` ‚Äî L-shaped movement (can jump over)
  - `Bishop` ‚Äî Diagonal
  - `Queen` ‚Äî Rook + Bishop movement
  - `King` ‚Äî One square any direction

---

### Board Management

**File:** `Board.java`  
- 8√ó8 board represented with a 2D array  
- `movePiece(startRow, startCol, endRow, endCol)` ‚Äî Validates and performs move  
- `isGameOver()` ‚Äî Returns true if a king is captured  
- `getPiece(row, col)` / `setPiece(row, col, piece)` ‚Äî Read/write board pieces  
- `toString()` ‚Äî Text representation of current board

**File:** `Fen.java`  
- `load(fen, board)` ‚Äî Parses FEN string and places pieces  
- Maps characters to piece objects and colors

---

### User Interface

**File:** `Game.java`  
- Console-based interface using `Scanner`  
- Displays board with Unicode characters  
- Prompts player input:  
  `startRow startCol endRow endCol`  
- Handles invalid inputs and retry logic  
- Announces game result

---

### File I/O (Planned)

- Supports loading standard board using FEN  
- Extendable to save/load game progress

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Compilation
javac src/chess_codepack/*.java

### Execution
java -cp src chess_codepack.Game

### Gameplay
Board Display: Shows 8√ó8 board with chess piece symbols

Input Format:
startRow startCol endRow endCol
Example: 6 0 4 0 (Moves a white pawn from a2 to a4)

Turn Order: White starts, alternates per move

Validation: Illegal moves are rejected with retry

Promotion: Pawns promote when reaching final rank

Game Over: Game ends when a king is captured


### ‚ú® Key Features
Full chess rule enforcement

Modular, object-oriented piece classes

Unicode-based visual console display

FEN notation support

Console-driven gameplay

Comprehensive move validation

Pawn promotion logic

Game over detection
