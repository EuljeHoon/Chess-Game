Run the program using Game.java class to show up the chess board and play the game.

Please be aware that to put start row, start col, end row, end col in a row to move the
specific pieces. Any other order won't be able to move the pieces.

If you put start row, start col, end row, end col without the space between each row and col,
it will keep waiting you to complete four numbers with the spaces. Just make sure to make the spaces between the numbers.
And also if you put the letter instead of the numbers, it will break the running.
